\section{Highlights}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Easily extensible, by defining a new  \texttt{Command} and  adding it to  \texttt{commands} list.
\item Simple and reliable  authentication  scheme by using underlying unix system.e.g. \texttt{availablecommands}.
\item Use of monadic computations such as in \texttt{seqn}, \texttt{printUsage}.
\item Extensive use of list operations such as \texttt{map} and \texttt{filter}. 
\item Simple buddy assignment.
\item Use of read and show functions to write  and read  data types from/to files.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Planned but not implemented}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Automatic e-mailing system. The system can use e-mail libraries to send e-mail to studnets.
\item Multiple twiz homeworks running parallel. The reafactored version (twizzer2.hs) has implementation for it.
\item GUI. We could add console gui for it that can reduce the need for typing in commands.
\item Under current assumption,  the system handles a single course. It can be extended to support 
\item multiple courses using \texttt{Course} data type.
\end{enumerate}
